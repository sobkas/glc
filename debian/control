Description: ALSA & OpenGL capture tool for Linux
 glc is an ALSA & OpenGL capture tool for Linux. It consists of a generic video
 capture, playback and processing library and a set of tools built around that
 library. glc should be able to capture any application that uses ALSA for sound
 and OpenGL for drawing. It is still a relatively new project but already has a
 long list of features.
 .
 glc is inspired by yukon (another, excellent real-time video capture tool for
 Linux) and Fraps (a popular Windows tool for the same purpose).
